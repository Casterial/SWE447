# **Final Project Proposal**
My project will be based around Quaternions as I’ve recently taken a liking to the mathematics to them and the usefulness with them in my major. After my original project which was to take my Quaternion library I’ve previously wrote to visually show the quaternions rotating in OpenGL. However, after recent rethinking of this project I decided to base the project on the same thing, but with a different way of doing the project.

# **Objective:**
After the comments and regards toward my project and further research I will be using a virtual trackball using quaternions and rotating an object using this. 

# **Sequence of Action:**
